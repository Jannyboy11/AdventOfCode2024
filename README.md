# Advent of Code solutions

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles.
They are implemented in [Scala](https://scala-lang.org).

## Running the code

Install [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).

Run `sbt run dayXX.main` where `XX` is one of `01` to `25`.

## IDE setup

I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the [Scala Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1347-scala/),
but [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Metals](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scalameta.metals) should work just as well.
